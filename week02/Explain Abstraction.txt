Abstraction is the process in which a programmer would break down parts of a complex program into
smaller my manageable sizes. One benefit of Abstraction is that it can give a developer the ability to 
better track the issues of a program. A way you can use this method would be to break up the program into separate
classes and methods that will work together.


Example:
using System.IO;

public class Journal
{
    public List<Entry> __entries = new List<Entry>();

    public void Save(String file_name)
    {
        using(StreamWriter file = new StreamWriter(file_name))
        {
            foreach (Entry entry in __entries)
            {
                file.WriteLine($"{entry.__date}~{entry.__prompt}~{entry.__entry}");
            }
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Journal Saved");
    }

    public void Load(String file_name)
    {
        try{
            String[] lines = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(file_name);

            __entries.Clear();

            int index = 0;
            foreach (String line in lines)
            {
                String[] lineParts = line.Split("~");

                Entry newEntry = new Entry();

                newEntry.__date = lineParts[0];
                newEntry.__prompt = lineParts[1];
                newEntry.__entry = lineParts[2];

                __entries.Add(newEntry);
                index++;
            }

            Console.WriteLine("Journal Loaded");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Could not find file, \"{file_name}\".");
            Console.WriteLine("Make sure you use the format, \"File Name.txt\"");
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        }
    }
    public void Display()
    {
        foreach (Entry entry in __entries)
        {
            entry.Display();
        }
    }
    public void AddEntry(Entry entry)
    {
        __entries.Add(entry);
    }
}

By breaking up the functionality of a journal into a separate class with its own methods, I can better read what this program is meant to do. In addition, I can be able
to fix any issues with the program here so any other classes that call this class do not need to be modified. This can save a lot of time when being part of much 
larger projects, and you do not have enough time or resources to correct any issues with parts of the program that run this kind of program.
